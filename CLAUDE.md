This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the Datamen strategic business planning repository.

## Project Context

**Datamen** is a strategic business planning repository for a Polish storage solutions company targeting creative and security industries. This is a **research and strategy project**, not a software codebase.

## Document Analysis Guidelines

### Market Research Standards
- When analyzing target companies, maintain structured profiles with: website, location, size, specialization, storage needs, pain points, opportunity assessment
- Financial data should remain in Polish złoty (PLN) with realistic projections
- Geographic analysis must include percentage distribution across Polish cities
- Preserve 3-tier (post-production) and 4-tier (CCTV) segmentation models

### Content Modification Rules
- **NEVER summarize** detailed company profiles - keep complete analysis
- Update market data with sources and dates when changes are made
- Maintain tabular format for competitive comparisons
- Include clickable website links for all mentioned companies
- Use Polish language for local market terminology

## Key Business Model Elements

### Revenue Tiers to Preserve
- **Post-production**: 2,000-30,000 PLN/month (3 tiers)
- **CCTV**: 3,000-80,000+ PLN/month (4 tiers)
- **Setup fees**: 5,000-100,000 PLN depending on tier
- **Target Year 1**: 4-9M PLN combined revenue

### Technical Focus Areas
- **ZFS/TrueNAS** as primary technology platform
- **RODO compliance** features for CCTV segment
- **High-throughput optimization** for video workflows
- **Open-source solutions** for cost-effectiveness

## Research Methodology

### Competitive Analysis
- Focus on **Polish market** players only
- Prioritize companies with **ZFS/TrueNAS** expertise
- Maintain **SME vs enterprise** distinction
- Track **eOnea.pl** as primary direct competitor

### Client Identification
- **Post-production**: 5-25 employees, creative workflows
- **CCTV/Security**: 20-200 employees, surveillance needs
- Geographic priority: **Warszawa, Gdańsk, Poznań, Kraków**

## Important Constraints

### What NOT to do
- Don't treat this as a software development project
- Don't create code files or technical implementations
- Don't modify financial projections without market research backing
- Don't remove detailed company analysis sections

### What TO focus on
- Market analysis accuracy and completeness
- Competitive positioning clarity
- Implementation timeline realism
- RODO compliance requirements (security segment)
- Multi-segment strategy coherence

## Document Structure Standards

- Use **clear section headers** with emoji for visual navigation
- Maintain **tabular format** for comparisons
- Include **complete company profiles** (never abbreviated)
- Preserve **implementation phases** (Foundation → Market Entry → Scale)
- Keep **success metrics** quantified and date-specific

This repository contains strategic intelligence, not code - approach it as business research requiring accuracy and completeness.
