# CLAUDE.md - Datamen Website Project

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the Datamen bilingual website project.

## Project Context

**Datamen** is a bilingual (Polish/English) marketing website project for a storage solutions company targeting post-production studios and CCTV/security companies. This is a **web development project** with focus on professional marketing presentation and lead generation.

## Website Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Design**: Glass morphism, dark theme, minimalist approach
- **Animation**: AOS library for scroll animations
- **Language System**: Dynamic bilingual switching with localStorage persistence
- **Development Server**: Python HTTP server for local testing

### Key Features
- âœ… **Bilingual Support**: Complete Polish/English content switching
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with glass morphism effects
- âœ… **Contact Integration**: Hidden WhatsApp integration with form fallback
- âœ… **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags, structured data, semantic HTML
- âœ… **Performance**: Lazy loading, optimized animations, minimal dependencies

## Critical Bilingual Content Management Rules

### **ðŸ”„ MANDATORY SYNCHRONIZATION PRINCIPLE**
**Whenever content is changed in Polish version, it MUST be simultaneously updated in English version**

### Translation Management Process
1. **Always update both languages simultaneously** - never leave one language incomplete
2. **Use the translation object in JavaScript** (`TRANSLATIONS` in `main.js`) as the single source of truth
3. **Verify data attributes** exist on HTML elements that need translation (`data-translate="key.path"`)
4. **Test language switching** after any content changes
5. **Maintain consistent messaging** across both languages

### Content Areas Requiring Synchronization
- **Navigation items** (`nav.about`, `nav.services`, etc.)
- **Hero section** (`hero.title`, `hero.subtitle`, `hero.ctaPrimary`, `hero.ctaSecondary`)
- **Service descriptions** (`services.postprod.*`, `services.cctv.*`)
- **Benefits/features** (`whyUs.benefit1-6.*`)
- **Process steps** (`process.step1-5.*`)
- **Contact form** (`contact.form.*`)
- **All section headers and descriptions**

## Development Guidelines

### Content Changes Workflow
1. **Identify the content** to be changed in both languages
2. **Update JavaScript translations** in `TRANSLATIONS` object first
3. **Verify HTML data attributes** are correctly assigned
4. **Test both language versions** work correctly
5. **Check mobile responsiveness** if layout changes were made

### Code Modification Rules
- **Preserve existing design patterns** (glass morphism, color scheme)
- **Maintain bilingual functionality** - never break language switching
- **Keep performance optimizations** (lazy loading, debouncing, throttling)
- **Follow existing naming conventions** for CSS classes and JS functions
- **Test WhatsApp integration** after form-related changes

### Design Principles
- **Color Scheme**: Deep navy (#0A1628) with turquoise accent (#00D9FF)
- **Typography**: Inter font family, responsive scaling
- **Effects**: Glass morphism backgrounds, smooth animations
- **Layout**: Mobile-first, responsive grid systems

### Development Tools Available
- **Playwright Browser Automation**: For testing language switching and UI validation
- **Python Development Server**: Local testing with `python3 server.py`
- **Live Reload**: Automatic browser refresh during development
- **Browser DevTools**: Console logging, performance monitoring
- **Git Version Control**: Track changes and maintain project history

## Technical Implementation

### Language System Architecture
- **Storage**: localStorage (`datamen-language`) for user preference
- **Detection**: Browser language detection with fallback to Polish
- **Switching**: Dynamic DOM content updates via `data-translate` attributes
- **Scope**: All text content, form labels, placeholders, meta tags

### Form and Integration Systems
- **Contact Form**: Simplified to name, contact (email/phone), message
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Hidden background sending with formatted messages
- **Validation**: Real-time validation with localized error messages
- **Submission**: Dual-channel (form endpoint + WhatsApp) with user feedback

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Checklist (After Any Changes)
- [ ] Both languages display correctly
- [ ] Language switcher updates active state
- [ ] All sections translate properly
- [ ] Form labels and placeholders are localized
- [ ] Mobile layout remains responsive
- [ ] WhatsApp integration sends correct language message
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Page load performance is maintained

### Automated Testing with Playwright
**Available for verification:** The development environment includes Playwright browser automation for comprehensive testing.

**Playwright Capabilities:**
- **Language switching verification**: Automatically test Polish â†” English transitions
- **UI element validation**: Verify all sections translate correctly
- **Navigation testing**: Check all internal links and menu functionality
- **Form testing**: Validate contact form behavior in both languages
- **Visual regression**: Take screenshots to compare layouts
- **Performance monitoring**: Check page load times and responsiveness

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
// Navigate to localhost:8000
// Click language switcher (PL â†’ EN)
// Verify footer navigation: "UsÅ‚ugi" â†’ "Services"
// Verify hero section: "Zapytaj o wycenÄ™" â†’ "Get a Quote"
// Take screenshots for visual comparison
```

**Testing Commands:**
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to load the website
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_click` to test language switching
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` to verify content changes
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot` for visual documentation

### Content Verification
- [ ] Polish and English messaging is consistent
- [ ] Technical terms are accurately translated
- [ ] Call-to-action buttons are appropriately localized
- [ ] Contact information is correct for target markets
- [ ] Services descriptions match business positioning
